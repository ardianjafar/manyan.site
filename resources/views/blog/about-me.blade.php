    <h4 class="section-title">ABOUT ME</h4>
    <p>
        Hi, my name is Jafarudin Ardian Maulana. I’m 23 years old and currently a student at Universitas Terbuka, majoring in English Literature. I am passionate about improving my English skills because I believe that speaking, writing, and listening are essential in today's global world. I once had a challenging experience while traveling abroad, which motivated me to enhance my language abilities. I have a strong passion for building things related to technology, and now I focus on website and mobile development. Since my time in vocational high school, I have never stopped learning new things—this constant learning has boosted my confidence to showcase my work, including on LinkedIn. Traveling is one of my hobbies. I have visited eight countries so far and plan to explore even more in the future. I built this website as part of my personal portfolio, where I also plan to write more blogs about English literature, technology, and my travel experiences around the world. Below, you’ll find more information about my education and projects.

This opportunity allowed me to deepen my knowledge and enhance my English skills by focusing on grammar, pronunciation, IELTS preparation, and public speaking. </p>

As an outcome of this learning experience, I successfully developed an Android application for COVID-19 monitoring, which displays real-time data on positive COVID-19 cases both globally and within Indonesia.</p>
